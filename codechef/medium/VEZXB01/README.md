## Problem

A positive integer d is said to be a factor of another positive integer N if when N is divided by d, the remainder obtained is zero. For example, for number 12, there are 6 factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Every positive integer k has at least two factors, 1 and the number k itself. Given two positive integers N and k, write a program to print the kth largest factor of N.

Input Format: The input is a comma-separated list of positive integer pairs (N, k). Output Format: The kth highest factor of N. If N does not have k factors, the output should be 1.

Constraints: 1<N<10000000000 1<k<600. You can assume that N will have no prime factors which are larger than 13.
