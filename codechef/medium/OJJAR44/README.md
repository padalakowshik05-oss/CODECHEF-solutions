## Problem

### Positive Numbers

In this problem, we will filter out negative numbers from an array of integers using the `filter()` method.

You are given an array of numbers, and you want to keep only the positive numbers (including zero). We'll use the `filter()` method for this.

- Use the filter() method: We will define a callback function that checks if each number is greater than or equal to zero. let positiveNumbers = numbers.filter((number) => { // Your code here });
- Result: After filtering, the positiveNumbers array will contain only those numbers that meet the condition. Print the positiveNumbers array to see the output.

    return number>=0;
});
console.log(positiveNumbers);
```
