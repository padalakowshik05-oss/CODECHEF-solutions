## Problem

### Find minimum in a rotated sorted array

Imagine you have an array of length $n$ that was initially sorted in increasing order, but then it was  **rotated**  some number of times between $1$ and $n$. A  **rotation**  consists of moving the last element of the array to the first position.

For example, if the sorted array is $numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]$, after rotating it 3 times, it becomes: $[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]$

Or after rotating 7 times, the array stays the same: $[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]$

Your task is: Given a  **rotated sorted array**  of  **distinct integers**, write an efficient algorithm to find and return the  **smallest element**  in the array.

Your solution must run in  **O(log n)**  time complexity.

## Function Declaration
### Function Name

$findMin$ – This function returns the minimum element in a rotated sorted array of distinct integers.

### Parameters
- $nums$ : A reference to a rotated sorted array of distinct integers.
### Return Value
- Returns the smallest integer present in the array.
### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer $T$ — number of test cases.
- For each test case: One line containing an integer $n$ — size of the array One line containing $n$ space-separated integers — the rotated sorted array
### Output Format
- For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum element in the array
### Constraints
- 1 <= T <= 100
- $1 \leq nums.length \leq 10^5$
- $-10^4 \leq nums[i] \leq 10^4$
- All elements in $nums$ are unique
- $nums$ is guaranteed to be a rotated version of a sorted array

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int l = 0;
        int h = nums.length - 1;

        while (l < h) {
            int m = l + (h - l) / 2;

            if (nums[m] > nums[h]) {
                l = m + 1;
            } else {
                h = m;
            }
        }

        return nums[l];
        
    }
}

```
