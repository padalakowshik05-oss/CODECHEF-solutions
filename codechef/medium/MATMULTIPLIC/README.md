## Problem

### Brute Force- Multiplication of Two Matrices

Matrix multiplication involves combining the rows of the first matrix with the columns of the second matrix to produce a new matrix. Specifically, let's say we have two matrices A and B, where A has dimensions  **M x N**  (M rows, N columns), and B has dimensions  **N x P**  (N rows, P columns). The resulting matrix C from the multiplication, denoted as C = A * B, will have dimensions  **M x P**.

To compute the element at position C[i][j] in the resulting matrix C, we take the dot product of the $i^{\text{th}}$ row of matrix A and the $j^{\text{th}}$ column of matrix B.

Mathematically, if A is represented as:

A = [[a11, a12,..., a1n], [a21, a22,..., a2n],..., [am1, am2,..., amn]]

and B is represented as:

B = [[b11, b12,..., b1p], [b21, b22,..., b2p],..., [bn1, bn2,..., bnp]]

then the resulting matrix C is calculated as:

C = [[c11, c12,..., c1p], [c21, c22,..., c2p],..., [cm1, cm2,..., cmp]]

where each element cij in matrix C is computed as:

cij = a[i][1] *b[1][j] + a[i][2]* b[2][j] +... + a[i][n]*b[n][j]

In other words, each element cij in the resulting matrix C is obtained by multiplying the corresponding elements of the ith row of matrix A with the corresponding elements of the jth column of matrix B and summing up the products.

For eg, see the multiplication of following two matrices:

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain two space separated integers $M$ and $N$, denoting the number of rows and columns of the first matrix.
- Next $M$ lines contains $N$ space separated integers, the elements of first matrix.
- Next line contain two space separated integers $N$ and $P$, denoting the number of rows and columns of the second matrix.
- Next $N$ lines contains $P$ space separated integers, the elements of second matrix.
### Output Format

Output $M$ lines, each containing $P$ space separated integers, the elements of multiplication matrix of first and second input matrices.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq N, M, P \leq 100$
- The elements of both the matrices are non-negative and won't exceed $1000$.
