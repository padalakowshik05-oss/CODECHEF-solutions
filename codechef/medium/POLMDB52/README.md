## Problem

### Task - Luxury Feature Filter
- You are managing the property_db. Users are complaining that searching for "Apartments" that have specific "Amenities" (like a "Pool") is becoming slow.
- Your Goal: Create a Compound Index that handles both a single value field (type) and an array field (amenities). This will result in a Compound Multikey Index.
- Identify the Two Keys: You need to index the field that stores the building category and the field that stores the list of features.
- Order Matters: In a compound index, it is usually best to put the field you filter by most (or the one that narrows down the results the most) first.
- The "Multikey" Magic: You don't need to do anything special for the array field. MongoDB will see the array and automatically treat that part of the index as a "Multikey."

 **Challenge Check** 

- Total Docs Examined: Before your index, this should be 3,000.
- Target: After your index, the number of documents examined should drop to roughly 250–375 (only the specific apartments that actually have a pool).

```cpp

}).explain("executionStats");
    amenities: "Solar"
    type: "Apartment",
const slowSearch = db.listings.find({

db.listings.insertMany(properties);
    });
}

        amenities: shuffled.slice(0, amenityCount)
        type: type,
        address: i + " Tech Lane",
    properties.push({

    const shuffled = [...features].sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random());

    const amenityCount = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1;

    const type = types[Math.floor(Math.random() * types.length)];

for (let i = 1; i <= 3000; i++) {
```
