## Problem

### Chef and Happy String

Chef has a string $S$ with him. Chef is happy if the string contains a  **contiguous substring**  of length  **strictly greater**  than $2$ in which all its characters are vowels.

Determine whether Chef is happy or not.

Note that, in english alphabet, vowels are `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u`.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains of a single line of input, a string $S$.
### Output Format

For each test case, if Chef is happy, print `HAPPY` else print `SAD`.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `hAppY`, `Happy`, `haPpY`, and `HAPPY` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $3 \leq |S| \leq 1000$, where $|S|$ is the length of $S$.
- $S$ will only contain lowercase English letters.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
aeiou
abxy
aebcdefghij
abcdeeafg

```

```
Happy
Sad
Sad
Happy

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Since the string `aeiou` is a contiguous substring and consists of all vowels and has a length $\gt 2$, Chef is happy.

 **Test case $2$:**  Since none of the contiguous substrings of the string consist of all vowels and have a length $\gt 2$, Chef is sad.

 **Test case $3$:**  Since none of the contiguous substrings of the string consist of all vowels and have a length $\gt 2$, Chef is sad.

 **Test case $4$:**  Since the string `eea` is a contiguous substring and consists of all vowels and has a length $\gt 2$, Chef is happy.

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int T = sc.nextInt();

        while (T-- > 0) {
            String s = sc.next();

            int count = 0;
            boolean happy = false;

            for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {

                char ch = s.charAt(i);

                if (ch == 'a' || ch == 'e' || ch == 'i' ||
                    ch == 'o' || ch == 'u') {

                    count++;

                    if (count >= 3) {
                        happy = true;
                        break;
                    }

                } else {
                    count = 0;
                }
            }

            if (happy)
                System.out.println("Happy");
            else
                System.out.println("Sad");
        }
    }
