## Problem

### Chef and Dolls

 

Chef is fan of pairs and he likes all things that come in pairs. He even has a doll collection in which the dolls come in pairs. One day while going through his collection he found that there are odd number of dolls. Someone had stolen a doll!!!

Help chef find which type of doll is missing..

### Input

The first line contains an integer  **T**, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer  **N**, the number of dolls.
The next  **N**  lines are the types of dolls that are left.

### Output

For each test case, display the type of doll that doesn't have a pair, in a new line.

### Constraints

1<=T<=10
1<=N<=100000 (10^5)
0<=type<=100000

### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
1
3
1 
2
1
```

```
2
```

### Explanation:

For this case, we have three dolls [1, 2, 1]. So we have two dolls of type 1, but only one doll of type 2. Thus one doll of type 2 is missing.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
1
5
1
1
2
2
3
```

```
3
```

### Explanation:

For this case [1, 1, 2, 2, 3], we have two dolls of type 1 and 2, but only one doll of type 3. Thus one doll of type 3 is missing.

class Codechef
{
    public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
    {
        // Input handling
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int T = sc.nextInt();  // Number of test cases
        
        while (T-- > 0) {
            int N = sc.nextInt();  // Size of the array
            int[] Arr = new int[N];
            
            // Reading array elements
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                Arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
            }
            
            // XOR operation to find the answer
            int ans = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                ans ^= Arr[i];
            }
            
            // Output the result
            System.out.println(ans);
        }
        
        sc.close();  // Closing the scanner
    }
}

```
