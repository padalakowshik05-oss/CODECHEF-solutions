# Count Prefix Maximums

## Problem

Given an array  **arr**  of integers, find the number of elements such that all the elements before them are smaller. The first element is always counted since there are no elements before it.

 **Examples** :

```
Input: arr = [10, 40, 23, 35, 50, 7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The elements 10, 40, and 50 are such that all preceding elements are smaller. Thus, the count is 3.
```

```
Input: arr = [5, 4, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Only the first element 5 is such that all preceding elements (none in this case) are smaller. Thus, the count is 1.
```

 **Constraints:** 

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109

```java
class Solution {
    public int countElements(int[] arr) {
        int n=arr.length;
        int cnt=1;
        int max=arr[0];
        
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            if(arr[i]>max){
                max=arr[i];
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
        
    }
}

```
