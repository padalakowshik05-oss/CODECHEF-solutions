# Replace Substring with Space

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

An encoded string  **s** consists of uppercase English letters. The string is formed by inserting the substring "LIE" at different positions in a secret message. Extract the original secret message by removing all occurrences of "LIE" from the encoded string.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: s = "LIEILIEAMLIELIECOOL"
Output: "I AM COOL"
Explanation: After removing every occurrence of "LIE", the remaining message is "I AM COOL".
```

```
Input: s = "LIELIEALIEBCLIE"
Output: "A BC"
Explanation: Removing all occurrences of "LIE" leaves "A BC".
```

```
