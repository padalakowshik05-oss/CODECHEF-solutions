# Sum of AP series

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

A series with same common difference is known as arithmetic series. The first term of series is ' **a** ' and common difference is  **d**. The series looks like a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d,... Find the sum of series upto  **nth**  term.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: n = 5, a = 1, d = 3
Output: 35
Explanation: Series upto 5th term is 1 4 7 10 13, so sum will be 35.

```

```
Input: n = 3, a = 1, d = 2
Output: 9
Explanation: Series upto 3rd term is 1 3 5, so sum will be 9.

```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ n ≤ 500
0 ≤ a, d ≤ 500

```java
class Solution {
    public int sumOfAP(int n, int a, int d) {
        int sum=n*((2*a)+(n-1)*d)/2;
        return sum;
    }
};
```
