# Snake Case

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given a sentence  **s**  consisting of English alphabet characters and spaces, convert it into snake_case.

In snake case:

- All letters are converted to lowercase.
- Words are separated by a single underscore ('_') instead of spaces.
- No spaces should appear in the resulting string.

Return the snake_case representation of the given sentence.

 **Note:**  The input sentence does not begin with a whitespace character.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: s = "Geeks ForGeeks"
Output: "geeks_forgeeks"
Explanation: All upper case characters are converted to lower case and the whitespace characters are replaced with underscore '_'.
```

```
Input: s = "Here comes the garden"
Output: "here_comes_the_garden"
Explanation: All upper case characters are converted to lower case and the whitespace characters are replaced with underscore '_'.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ n ≤ 105, n is length of the sentence

class Solution {
    public String snakeCase(String s) {
        StringBuilder ans=new StringBuilder();
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
            char c=Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(i));
            if(c==' '){
                ans.append('_');
            }else{
              ans.append(c);  
            }
        }
        return new String(ans);
        
    }
}
```
