![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given a number in form of a string  **s**. Check whether it is  **divisible by 4**  or not.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: s = "1124"
Output: true
Explanation: The last two digits of "1124" are 24. Since 24 is divisible by 4, the given number is also divisible by 4. Hence, the output is true.

```

```
Input: s = "7"
Output: false
Explanation: As 7 % 4 = 3, the number is not divisible by 4. Hence, the output is false.

```

```java
class Solution {
    boolean divisibleBy4(String s) {
      int n = s.length();

      if (n == 1) {
          return (s.charAt(0) - '0') % 4 == 0;
      }

      int lastTwo = (s.charAt(n - 2) - '0') * 10
                  + (s.charAt(n - 1) - '0');

      return lastTwo % 4 == 0;  
        
    }
}
```
