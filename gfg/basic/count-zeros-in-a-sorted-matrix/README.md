![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given a  **n * n** binary Square Matrix where each row and column of the matrix is sorted in ascending order. Find the total number of  **zeros**  present in the matrix.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: mat[][] = [[0,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,1,1]]
 
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The first, second and third row contains 3, 2 and 1
zeroes respectively.
```

```
Input: mat[][] = [[1,1], [1,1]]
 
Output: 0
Explanation:
There are no zeroes in any of the rows.
```

class Solution {
    public int countZeros(int[][] mat) {
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<mat.length;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<mat[0].length;j++){
                if(mat[i][j]==0){
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
        
        
    }
};
```
