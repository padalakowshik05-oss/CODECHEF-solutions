![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**  containing only **0s, 1s, and 2s.**  Sort the array in ascending order. 
 **Note:**  You need to solve this problem without utilizing the built-in sort function.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s, 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s, 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
```

 **Follow up:**  Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?

```java
class Solution {
    public void sort012(int[] arr) {
        int low = 0;
                int mid = 0;
                int high = arr.length - 1;

                while (mid <= high) {

                    if (arr[mid] == 0) {
                        int temp = arr[low];
                        arr[low] = arr[mid];
                        arr[mid] = temp;

                        low++;
                        mid++;

                    } else if (arr[mid] == 1) {
                        mid++;

                    } else {
                        int temp = arr[mid];
                        arr[mid] = arr[high];
                        arr[high] = temp;

                        high--;
                    }
                }
        
    }
}
```
