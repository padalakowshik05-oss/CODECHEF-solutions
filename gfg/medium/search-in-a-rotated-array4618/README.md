# Search in Rotated Sorted Array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**  of  **distinct** elements, which was initially  **sorted in ascending order**  but then  **rotated**  at some unknown pivot, the task is to find the index of a target  **key**.  If the key is not present in the array, return  **-1**.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: arr[] = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3], key = 3
Output: 8
Explanation: 3 is found at index 8.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [3, 5, 1, 2], key = 6
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no element that has value 6.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [33, 42, 72, 99], key = 42
Output: 1
Explanation: 42 is found at index 1.
```

    int search(int[] arr, int key) {
        int n=arr.length;
        int l=0;
        int h=n-1;
        while(l<=h){
            int mid=l+(h-l)/2;
            
            if(arr[mid]==key){
                return mid;
            }
            else if(arr[l]<=arr[mid]){
                if(arr[l]<=key && key<arr[mid]){
                    h=mid-1;
                }
                else{
                    l=mid+1;
                }
            }
            else{
                if(arr[mid]<key && key<=arr[h]){
                    l=mid+1;
                }
                else{
                    h=mid-1;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
        
    }
}
