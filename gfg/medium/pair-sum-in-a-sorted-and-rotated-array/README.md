# Pair Sum in a Sorted and Rotated Array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an array of positive elements   arr[]   that is  **sorted**  and then  **rotated**  around an unknown point, the task is to check if the array has a pair with sum equals to a given   target .

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [7, 9, 1, 3, 5], target = 6
Output: true
Explanation: arr[2] and arr[4] has sum equals to 6 which is equal to the target.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 1], target = 3
Output: true
Explanation: arr[0] and arr[3] has sum equals to 3 which is equal to the target.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 7, 4, 1], target = 9
Output: false
Explanation: There is no such pair exists in arr[] which sums to target.

```

**Constraints:
**2 <= arr.size() <=106
1 <= arr[i] <= 106
1 <= target <= 106

```java

class Solution {
    static boolean pairInSortedRotated(int arr[], int target) {
        HashSet<Integer> set=new HashSet<>();
        for(int num: arr){
            int needed=target-num;
            if(set.contains(needed)){
                return true;
            }
            set.add(num);
        }
        return false;
        
    }
}

```
