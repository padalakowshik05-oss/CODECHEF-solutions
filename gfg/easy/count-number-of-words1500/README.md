# Count Words in a String

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a string  **s**  consisting of lowercase English alphabets, spaces, tab characters (\t), and newline characters (\n),  **count**  the total number of  **words**  present in the string. A word is defined as a continuous sequence of lowercase English letters, while spaces, tabs, and newline characters act as separators between words.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: s = "abc def"
Output: 2
Explanation: There is a space at 4th position which works as a seperator between "abc" and "def".

```

```
Input: s = "a\nyo\t"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two words in the string: "a" and "yo". The characters \n and \t act as separators, splitting the string into words.
```

 **Constraints:** 
2 <= Length of String <= 106

```java
class Solution {
    public int countWords(String s) {
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);

            if (ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z') {
                if (i == 0 || s.charAt(i - 1) == ' ' 
                          || s.charAt(i - 1) == '\t' 
                          || s.charAt(i - 1) == '\n') {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
        
    }
}
```
