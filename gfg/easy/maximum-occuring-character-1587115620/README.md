# Most Frequent Character

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a string  **s** of lowercase alphabets. The task is to find the maximum occurring character in the string  **s**. If more than one character occurs the maximum number of times then print the lexicographically smaller character.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: s = "testsample"
Output: 'e'
Explanation: 'e' is the character which is having the highest frequency.
```

```
Input: s = "output"
Output: 't'
Explanation: 't' and 'u' are the characters with the same frequency, but 't' is lexicographically smaller.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100

```java
class Solution {
    public static char getMaxOccuringChar(String s) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            map.put(ch, map.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
        }

        char ans = 'z';
        int max = 0;

        for (char ch : map.keySet()) {
            if (map.get(ch) > max || 
                (map.get(ch) == max && ch < ans)) {
                max = map.get(ch);
                ans = ch;
            }
        }

        return ans;
        
    }
}
```
