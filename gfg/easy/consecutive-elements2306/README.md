![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a string  **s**, consisting of lowercase alphabets. Remove consecutive duplicate characters from the string. 

 **Example:** 

```
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: "ab" 
Explanation: The character 'a' at index 2 is the same as 'a' at index 1, so it is removed.Similarly, the character 'b' at index 4 is the same as 'b' at index 3, so it is removed. The final string is "ab".

```

```
Input: s = "aabaa"
Output: "aba"
Explanation: The character 'a' at index 2 is the same as 'a' at index 1, so it is removed. The character 'a' at index 5 is the same as 'a' at index 4, so it is removed. The final string is "aba".
```

```
Input: s = "aaaa"
Output: "a"
Explanation: "aaaa" => "aaa" => "aa" => "a" 
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ n ≤ 106
All characters in the string are lowercase English alphabets.

```java
class Solution {
    public String removeDuplicates(String s) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

                result.append(s.charAt(0));

                for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
                    if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i - 1)) {
                        result.append(s.charAt(i));
                    }
                }

                return result.toString();
        
    }
}
