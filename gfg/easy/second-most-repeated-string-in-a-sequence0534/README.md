# Second Most Frequent Word

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a sequence of strings  **arr[]**, find and return the second highest frequency (count of occurrences) among all strings in the array.

 **Note:** 

- If all strings have the same frequency, return -1.
- If there is only one unique string in the array, return -1.
- If the array is empty, return -1.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = ["aaa", "bbb", "ccc", "bbb", "aaa", "aaa"]
Output: 2
Explanation: "bbb" is the second most occurring string with frequency 2. So the answer for this test case is 2.

```

```
Input: arr[] = ["aaa", "aaa", "aaa", "aaa", "aaa", "aaa"]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is only one unique string with frequency 6. So answer for this test case is -1.
```

    public int secFrequent(String[] arr) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (String s : arr) {
            map.put(s, map.getOrDefault(s, 0) + 1);
        }

        int first = 0;
        int second = 0;
        for (int freq : map.values()) {
            if (freq > first) {
                second = first;
                first = freq;
            } else if (freq > second && freq < first) {
                second = freq;
            }
        }

        return second == 0 ? -1 : second;
    }
}
```
