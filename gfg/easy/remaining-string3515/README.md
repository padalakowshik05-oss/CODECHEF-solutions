# Remaining String

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a string  **s**  without spaces (both lowercase and uppercase), a character  **ch** and an integer  **count.** Your task is to return the substring that remains after the character  **ch** has appeared  **count** number of times.
 **Note:**  Assume upper case and lower case alphabets are different. “”(**Empty string**) should be returned if it is not possible, or the remaining substring is empty.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: s = "Thisisdemostring", ch = 'i', count = 3
Output: ng
Explanation: The remaining substring of s after the 3rd
occurrence of 'i' is "ng", hence the output is ng.
```

```
Input: s = "Thisisdemostri", ch = 'i', count = 3
Output: ""
Explanation: The 3rd occurence of 'i' is at the last index. In this case the remaining substring is empty, hence we return empty string.
```

```
Input: s = "abcd", ch = 'x', count = 2
Output: ""
Explanation: The character x is not present in the string, hence we return empty string.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ s.length() ≤ 105
1 ≤ count ≤ s.length()

```java
class Solution {
    public String printString(String s, char ch, int count) {
        StringBuilder ans=new StringBuilder();
        int count1=0;
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
            char c=s.charAt(i);
                if(count1>=count){
                    ans.append(c);
                }
                if(c==ch){
                    count1++;
                }
        }
        return ans.toString();
        
    }
}
```
