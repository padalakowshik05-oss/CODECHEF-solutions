# Intersection of Two Sorted Arrays

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given two sorted arrays  **arr1** [] and  **arr** 2[]. Your task is to return the  **intersection** of both arrays.
Intersection of two arrays is said to be elements that are common in both arrays. The intersection should not count duplicate elements.
Note: If there is no intersection then return an empty array.

 **Examples**  **:** 

```
Input: arr1[] = [1, 2, 3, 4], arr2[] = [2, 4, 6, 7, 8]
Output: [2, 4]
Explanation: 2 and 4 are only common elements in both the arrays.
```

```
Input: arr1[] = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4], arr2[] = [2, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8]
Output: [2, 4]
Explanation: 2 and 4 are the only common elements.
```

```
Input: arr1[] = [1, 2], arr2[] = [3, 4]
Output: []
Explanation: No common elements.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr1.size(),arr2.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr1[i], arr2[i] ≤ 106

```java
class Solution {
    static ArrayList<Integer> intersection(int arr1[], int arr2[]) {
        ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();

        int n = arr1.length;
        int m = arr2.length;

        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;

        while (i < n && j < m) {

            if (i > 0 && arr1[i] == arr1[i - 1]) {
                i++;
                continue;
            }

            if (j > 0 && arr2[j] == arr2[j - 1]) {
                j++;
                continue;
            }

            if (arr1[i] == arr2[j]) {
                ans.add(arr1[i]);
                i++;
                j++;
            }
            else if (arr1[i] < arr2[j]) {
                i++;
            }
            else {
                j++;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
