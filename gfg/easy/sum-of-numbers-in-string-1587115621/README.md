## Problem

Given a string  **s** containing alphanumeric characters. You have to calculate the sum of all the numbers present in the string.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: s = "1abc23"
Output: 24
Explanation: 1 and 23 are numbers in the string which is added to get the sum as 24.

```

```
Input: s = "geeks4geeks"
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 is the only number, so the sum is 4.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public static int findSum(String s) {
        int sum = 0;
               int num = 0;

               for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {

                   if (Character.isDigit(s.charAt(i))) {
                       num = num * 10 + (s.charAt(i) - '0');
                   } 
                   else {
                       sum += num;
                       num = 0;
                   }
               }

               sum += num;

               return sum;
        
    }
}
```
