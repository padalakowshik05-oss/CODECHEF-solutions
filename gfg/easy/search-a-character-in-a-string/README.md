# Search a Character in a String

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Write a program to search for a given character in a string. If the character is found, print the  **index/position**  where it first appears in the string. If the character is not found, print  **-1**.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: s = "geeksforgeeks", ch = 'k'
Output: 3
Explanation: The character 'k' is present at index 3 and 11 in "geeksforgeeks", so the first index is 3.
```

```
Input: s = "geeksforgeeks", ch = 'z'
Output: -1
Explanation: The character 'z' is not present in "geeksforgeeks".

```

**Constraints:
**1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105

    public int searchCharacter(String s, char ch) {
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
            if(s.charAt(i)==ch){
                return i;
            }
        }
