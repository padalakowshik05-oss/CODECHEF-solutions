# Encrypt the string - 2

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given a string  **S**. Every sub-string of identical letters is replaced by a single instance of that letter followed by the hexadecimal representation of the number of occurrences of that letter. Then, the string thus obtained is further encrypted by reversing it [ See the sample for more clarity ]. Print the Encrypted String.

 **Note:** All Hexadecimal letters should be converted to Lowercase letters.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input:
S = "aaaaaaaaaaa"
Output:
ba 
Explanation: 
aaaaaaaaaaa
Step1: a11 (a occurs 11 times)
Step2: a11 is ab [since 11 is b in
hexadecimal]
Step3: ba [After reversing]
```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input:
S = "abc"
Output:
1c1b1a
Explanation: 
abc
Step1: a1b1c1
Step2: 1c1b1a [After reversing]
```

 

 **Your Task:** 
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function  **encryptString()**  which takes a String S and returns the answer.

 

 **Expected Time Complexity:**  O(|S|)
 **Expected Auxiliary Space:**  O(1)

 **Constraints** 
1 <= |S| <= 105

```java
class Solution {
    static String encryptString(String S) {
        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();

        int i = S.length() - 1;

        while (i >= 0) {
            char c = S.charAt(i);
            int count = 0;

            while (i >= 0 && S.charAt(i) == c) {
                count++;
                i--;
            }

            ans.append(Integer.toHexString(count));
            ans.append(c);
        }

        return ans.toString();
    }
};
```
