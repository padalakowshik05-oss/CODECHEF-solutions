# Closest Sum Pair Across Two Arrays

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given two  **sorted**  arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of size n and m and a number x, find the pair whose sum is closest to x and the pair has an element from each array. In the case of multiple closest pairs return any one of them.

 **Note**  : In the driver code, the absolute difference between the sum of the closest pair and x is printed.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input : arr1[] = [1, 4, 5, 7], arr2[] = [10, 20, 30, 40], x = 32
Output : [1, 30]
Explanation:The closest pair whose sum is closest to 32 is [1, 30] = 31.

```

```
Input : arr1[] = [1, 4, 5, 7], arr2[] = [10, 20, 30, 40], x = 50 
Output : [7, 40] 
Explanation: The closest pair whose sum is closest to 50 is [7, 40] = 47.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr1.size(), arr2.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr1[i], arr2[i] ≤ 109
1 ≤ x ≤ 109

```java
class Solution {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> findClosestPair(int arr1[], int arr2[], int x) {
        int i = 0;
               int j = arr2.length - 1;
               ArrayList<Integer> ans=new ArrayList<>();

               int diff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

               while (i < arr1.length && j >= 0) {
                   int sum = arr1[i] + arr2[j];
                   int currDiff = Math.abs(sum - x);

                   if (currDiff < diff) {
                       diff = currDiff;
                       ans.clear();
                       ans.add(arr1[i]);
                       ans.add(arr2[j]);
                   }

                   if (sum < x) {
                       i++;
                   } else {
                       j--;
                   }
               }

               return ans;
        
    }
}
```
