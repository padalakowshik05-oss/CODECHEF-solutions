# Move All Zeroes to End

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an array  **arr[]**  of non-negative integers. You have to move all the zeros in the array to the right end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. The operation must be performed  **in place**, meaning you should not use extra space for another array.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: There are three 0s that are moved to the end.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: [10, 20, 30]
Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 0]
Output: [0, 0]
Explanation: No change in array as there are all 0s.
```

```java
class Solution {
    void pushZerosToEnd(int[] arr) {
        int left = 0;

               for (int right = 0; right < arr.length; right++) {

                   if (arr[right] != 0) {
                       int temp = arr[left];
                       arr[left] = arr[right];
                       arr[right] = temp;

                       left++;
                   }
               }
        
    }
}
```
