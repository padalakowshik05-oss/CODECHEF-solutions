# Two Sum in Sorted Array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given a 1-based indexed integer array  **arr[]**  that is sorted in non-decreasing order, along with an integer  **target**. Your task is to find two elements in the array such that their sum is equal to  **target**. If such a pair exists, return the **indices**  of the two elements in  **increasing order**. If no such pair exists, return **[-1, -1].
Note: **If your answer is correct then the driver code will print "true" otherwise "false".

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation: Since arr[0] + arr[1] = 2 + 7 = 9 equals the target, return their 1-based indices : [1, 2]
```

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11], target = 10
Output: [3, 4]
Explanation: Since arr[2] + arr[3] = 4 + 6 = 10 equals the target, return their 1-based indices : [3, 4]
```

**Constraints:
**1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i], target ≤ 106

```java
class Solution {
    public ArrayList<Integer> twoSum(int[] arr, int target) {
        ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            int needed = target - arr[i];

            if (map.containsKey(needed)) {
                ans.add(map.get(needed) + 1);
                ans.add(i + 1);
                return ans;
            }

            map.put(arr[i], i);
        }

        ans.add(-1);
        ans.add(-1);
        return ans;
    }
}
```
